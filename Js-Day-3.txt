1.For the given JSON iterate over all for loops (for, for in, for of, forEach)
Answer:
        for:
           let str = '';
              for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
                str = str + i;
             }

       for in:
             const object = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
                  for (const property in object) {
                       console.log(`${property}: ${object[property]}`);
             }
   
       for of:
             const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
               for (const element of array1) {
                console.log(element);
             }

        forEach:
               const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
                 array1.forEach(element => console.log(element));
